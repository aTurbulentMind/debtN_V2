		Software Evaluation Support The evaluation of collection agency software breaks down into these
		basic steps:
		<br /><br />
		Agency Requirements Analysis<br /><br />
		Preliminary Market Canvas<br /><br />
		Comprehensive Software Feature Analysis<br /><br />
		Company Investigation of Software Vendors<br />
	</p>

	<p class="text_Box cut_Box">
		Determine agency requirements by examining agency operations. Since most software will cover
		"normal" business practices, you will want to pay close attention to specialized functions of
		your agency. The evaluation should:
		<br /><br />
		Review the categories of collections your agency pursues (retail, medical, checks, commercial) including
		specialized markets such as debt buying and student loans.
		<br /><br />
		Closely examine special and priority client requirements, agency financial deals, reporting and automated
		processes.
		<br /><br />
		Daily operations, such as data entry, payment processing, skip tracing, legal processing, notice
		generation and credit reports should be reviewed.
		<br /><br />
		Review accounting practices such as statements, trust accounting, month end processes, activity tracking,
		collector compensation and auditing.
		<br /><br />
		High-profile problems the agency is currently trying to resolve should be considered at this time
		as well. You will want to think about the growth plan of the agency and evaluate the adequacy of
		your existing equipment.

	<p class="text_Box cut_Box">
		To choose the best software, start with a preliminary market canvas to identify top candidates
		based on fit, appearance, and recommendations. Explore product literature, websites, industry
		sources, and recommendations to create a manageable list. Dig into the features of top
		candidates, ensuring they meet agency requirements. Use a checklist to track capabilities.
		Obtain demonstration software and conduct walk-thrus to evaluate usability and support.
	</p>
	<p class="text_Box cut_Box">
		However, having the right features isn't enough. Research the vendor's competency, industry
		experience, and business practices. Consider their size, longevity, market share, and
		reputation. Inquire about bug fixes, problem resolution, product advancement, and support
		services. These factors are crucial for maintaining your collection agency's health.
